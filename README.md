# Project 5 - Cloud DevOps Engineer Capstone Project

## About Project: 
I created a CI/CD pipeline for a website that deploys to a cluster in AWS EKS which is Blue/Green Deployment. The images below shows the stages of the pipelines. In fact I used not only one, but two pipelines. The Jenkinsfile of the first pipeline is into the folder "cluster". I didn't found the way to run both pipelines located in the same repository, then the Jenkinsfile in "cluster" was run from another repository.
