# Project 5 - Cloud DevOps Engineer Capstone Project

## About Project: 
I created a CI/CD pipeline for a website that deploys to a cluster in AWS EKS which is Blue/Green Deployment. The images below shows the stages of the pipelines. In fact I used not only one, but two pipelines. The Jenkinsfile of the first pipeline is into the folder "cluster". I didn't found the way to run both pipelines located in the same repository, then the Jenkinsfile in "cluster" was run from another repository.

## Run the project:

1. In AWS Launch the EC2 t2.micro for the free tier, pick â€œUbuntu 18.04 LTS amd64"

2. Make sure that the IAM user that you are using has all of the correct permissions.

3. Henceforth, to install packages, log in your AWS EC2 using ssh and a pem file, like this: 
   * ssh -i "pipeline.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-160-81-248.compute-1.amazonaws.com

4. Install Jenkins on the AWS EC2

5. Set up Jenkins, install the blue ocean (https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean) and pipeline-aws (https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-aws) plugins in jenkins

6. Create account in docker.com

7. Register AWS and Docker credentials into Jenkins (see folder capstoneImages)

8. Install docker. 
   * sudo apt-get update
   * sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
   * curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   * sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
   * sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   * sudo apt-get update
   * sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   * sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
   * sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart
   
9. Install the necessary dependencies to deploy your cluster with AWS EKS. Follow this tutorial 
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html. 

10. In Jenkins, use the Blue Ocean link to create a new pipeline
   * create a GitHub token using the link https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,user:email,write:repo_hook or use a previous created token
11. Install tidy, sudo apt-get install -y tidy
12. Copy the content of folder "cluster" to another repository and then linked this to a pipeline in Jenkins
13. Linked this repository to another pipeline
14. Build commits to pipelines, review logs and correct bugs
